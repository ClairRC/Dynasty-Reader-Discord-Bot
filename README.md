~~This personal project is a discord bot which will alert me of new chapters uploaded to dynasty-scans.com
It also allows me to save the chapters locally if I want.
Currently, this is specific to me and my Discord server and pc and such, and it's also written kinda badly.
I'd like to come back to this sometime to make it more generalized and just better written now that I know more. For now though, it's just a me thing.~~

This is basically useless since dynasty became much faster, fixed their email subscription system, and have an option for downloading built in.
Still a fun project :) 

It's also worth mentioning that when I made this, I made the silly mistake of not removing my API token for Discord, so that is not actually currently active. But I've learned my lesson.
